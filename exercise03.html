        This is a homework assignment, but a classic one. I'm a little baby coder.

        I'm really leaning into the snail colors now. It feels a shame to place him in a box. The
        image was transparent and everything â€“ love a transparent image. Oh, I should draw something
        transparent and use that for a future assignment like this. Sorry, <em>Adventure Time</em>
        snail, you are about to be replaced by a creation of my own hands.
