        If you go to the NASA website, you can find nearly endless galaries of photos. You can search by telescope, or by space probe, such as New Horizons. This photo is from Hubble and shows several galaxies. A lot of them are edge-on, which is why they look more like lines than disks. You can also make out that several of the galaxies are spirals, like our Milky Way Galaxy. But some of them are elipticals.

          Fun fact: every image you've ever seen of our whole galaxy has been an artist's imagining. Of course, that makes sense if you think about it. We've barely gotten probes out past Pluto, let alone out of the <em>galaxy</em>. Our Galaxy's diameter is probably about 50 thousand kilaparsecs across. A parsec, for those of you who watched <em> Star Wars </em> and wondered, is a distance measurement equal to about 3.26 lightyears. But the Galaxy is a a lot shorter than it is wide. Edge-on, the spiral arms are about 350 parsecs tall.
